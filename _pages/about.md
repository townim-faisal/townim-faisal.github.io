Greetings, I am Townim Faisal Chowdhury ðŸ˜Š. Currently, I am doing Ph.D. in Computer Science at the Centre for Augmented Reasoning, [Australian Institute of Machine Learning (AIML)](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml/about-us), [University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/), Australia. I have earned B.Sc degree in Computer Science & Engineering with Summa cum-laude from [North South University](http://www.northsouth.edu/), Dhaka, Bangladesh. I have two years of teaching assistant experience at [North South University](http://www.northsouth.edu/), as well as research assistant experience in computer vision research under [Dr. Shafin Rahman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Pe8C-SUAAAAJ&hl=en). I have also served as a research assistant under [Dr. Ahsanur Rahman](https://sites.google.com/site/rahmanmahsanur)'s supervision, where I worked on Graph theory. 

In addition, I have 4+ years of professional experience in the industry with a background in software engineering. My skillset extends beyond just building web applications to include managing teams, communicating with clients, tackling novel machine learning (ML) product development challenges, and more. Improving myself on cutting-edge technology, software, and deep learning methods is one of my primary interests. I like building machine learning models and data pipelines. To some extent, I enjoy being in a position to take on a variety of roles.


I am actively doing research in the computer vision field. My research interests lies in computer vision of deep learning: explainable AI, medical imaging, meta learning, continual learning, 3D point cloud objects.
