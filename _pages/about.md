Hello! Iâ€™m **Townim Faisal Chowdhury**, a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the [Centre for Augmented Reasoning, Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML)](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml/about-us), [University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/), supervised by [Dr. Zhibin Liao](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/zhibin.liao).  

My research focuses on **explainable and trustworthy AI (XAI)** for medical image analysis and multimodal models. I develop methods that make AI systems transparent, reliable, and clinically meaningful that helps clinicians understand not just what a model predicts, but why. My Ph.D. thesis has led to multiple publications at top-tier venues such as **CVPR, MICCAI, and ICCV**.  

Before my Ph.D., I earned my **B.Sc. in Computer Science & Engineering (Summa Cum Laude)** from [North South University](http://www.northsouth.edu/), Dhaka, Bangladesh. There, I worked as a research assistant with [Dr. Shafin Rahman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Pe8C-SUAAAAJ&hl=en) on meta-learning for 3D point cloud data and with [Dr. Ahsanur Rahman](https://sites.google.com/site/rahmanmahsanur) on graph algorithms.  

Alongside academia, I bring **4+ years of industry experience** in software and machine learning engineering. Most recently, I worked as a **Research Scientist Intern at [Dolby Laboratories](https://www.dolby.com/)**, where I explored interpretability in multimodal large language models (e.g., AudioLLMs) using Sparse autoencoder (SAE). Previously, I held roles in data engineering and AI product development, where I led teams, built ML pipelines, and worked closely with clients on deploying real-world solutions.  

My broader research interests span **multimodal AI, model's interpretability, generative AI, meta-learning, and continual learning**. I enjoy bridging research and applicationâ€”whether thatâ€™s developing interpretable AI for healthcare or tackling new challenges in large-scale ML systems.  

ðŸ‘‰ You can explore my **[publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Jwefna0AAAAJ)** and **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/townim-faisal-chowdhury/)** for more details.  
**Currently, I am actively seeking Research Scientist or Applied Scientist opportunities.**
