Greetings, I am Townim Faisal Chowdhury ðŸ˜Š. Currently, I am doing Ph.D. in Computer Science (final year) at the Centre for Augmented Reasoning, [Australian Institute of Machine Learning (AIML)](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml/about-us), [University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/), Australia under the supervision of [Dr. Zhibin Liao](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/zhibin.liao). My thesis focuses on ensuring that AI models used in medical image analysis are explainable, trustworthy, and transparent for clinicians. I have earned B.Sc degree in Computer Science & Engineering with Summa cum-laude from [North South University](http://www.northsouth.edu/), Dhaka, Bangladesh. I have worked as a research assistant under [Dr. Shafin Rahman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Pe8C-SUAAAAJ&hl=en) in the field of computer vision, focusing on meta-learning for 3D point cloud data. Additionally, I have also served as a research assistant under [Dr. Ahsanur Rahman](https://sites.google.com/site/rahmanmahsanur)'s supervision, where I worked on Graph theory. 

In addition, I have 4+ years of professional experience in the industry with a background in software engineering. My skillset extends beyond just building web applications to include managing teams, communicating with clients, tackling novel machine learning (ML) product development challenges, and more. Improving myself on cutting-edge technology, software, and deep learning methods is one of my primary interests. I like building machine learning models and data pipelines. To some extent, I enjoy being in a position to take on a variety of roles. _<span style="color:violet">You can check my professional industry experiences in [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/townim-faisal-chowdhury/).</span>_

My research focuses on trustworthy and explainable AI (XAI), particularly in medical imaging. My broader research interests include explainable and trustworthy AI, multimodal AI, generative AI, meta-learning, and continual learning.. **Currently, I am actively seeking Research Scientist or Applied Scientist opportunities.**
