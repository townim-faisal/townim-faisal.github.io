* **Deep  Neural Network based Lipid Profile Prediction:**
  
  **Technology:** R, ggplot, h2o & shiny. 
  
  This study is aimed to develop an artificial neural network (ANN) based model with various input combinations to predict lipid profiles of the US adults using non-invasive and low-cost diagnostic features. This project was supervised under the supervision of [Juwel Rana](http://www.northsouth.edu/faculty-members/shls/pbh/juwel-rana.html), Lecturer in Department of Public Health, North South University.

* **Hyperparameter Analysis For Image Captioning Based On Different Languages:**
  
  **Technology:** Python, PyTorch, Scikit-learn & Numpy. 
  
  We analyzed different hyperparameter combinations for two state-of-the-art image captioning models based on different languages: chinese, bangla and english and tried to find suitable combinations of hyperparameters with this analysis. This project was supervised under the supervision of. This ewxperiment was supervised under the supervision of [Dr. Md Shahriar Karim](http://ece.northsouth.edu/people/md-shahriar-karim/), Assistant Professor, North South University.

* **A Web App for Transportation and Carpooling Mangement in Bangladesh:**
  
  **Technology:** PHP, Laravel, MySQL, OpenLayer, pgRouting & postGIS. 
  
  In this work, we designed and implemented a web-app for transportation and carpooling management. Our app makes the major services provided by BRTA easily accessible from anywhere, has the potential to reduce cost, environment pollution, and traffic congestions via carpooling, and ensures transparency among all the stakeholders: BRTA, vehicleowners, drivers, and passengers.
